Hi Josh, Iâ€™ve granted you engineer_role in Snowflake. 

 

We currently ingest data from 24 ADP tables of which 7 have defined source models immediately available to you.

These SQL statements will show you the available source and staging models. 

 

use role data_role;

use warehouse data_wh;

use database analytics;



show tables like '%ADP%' in schema analytics.source;

show tables like '%ADP%' in schema analytics.staging;



-- Sample query against the ADP Persons table

SELECT *

FROM

    analytics.source.src_adp_persons

WHERE

    person_worker_id IN ( '9V0WOIFLL' );

-- QUALIFY

--     ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER 

--         (PARTITION BY person_worker_id 

--         ORDER BY person_timestamp DESC ) = 1;
 

If you need access to data in any of other tables, let me know and we can come up with a plan to make that available.
